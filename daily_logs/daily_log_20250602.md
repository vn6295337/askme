- Archived all previous versions of planning and related docs in `/archives/` with date-based naming.
- Updated resource planning to include atomic action items, owner/contributor mapping, and technical resource requirements.
- Updated the document index and all related documents to reflect new file names, archive locations, and checklist-to-project-plan mapping.
