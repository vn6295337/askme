# Security Threat Intelligence Report - AskMe CLI Backend

**System:** AskMe CLI Backend (https://askme-backend-proxy.onrender.com)  
**Assessment Date:** July 26, 2025  
**Classification:** Internal Use  

## Classical Security Threats

### API Key Exposure
**Description:** Software stores sensitive access credentials in unprotected memory where unauthorized users can extract them.  
**Example Scenario:** A developer runs a memory analysis tool on the server and finds our Google AI API key stored in plain text, then uses it to rack up $50,000 in unauthorized charges.  
**Impact if Unaddressed:** Unauthorized API usage charges exceeding $100,000 monthly, suspension of AI provider accounts.  
**Mitigation:** Implemented secure key storage with encrypted hashing (e.g., `444cc12a` for Google API key) and automatic memory clearing after system startup.  
**Compliance Mapping:** NIST CSF PR.AC-1, ISO 27001 A.10.1.1, OWASP ASVS V2.10.1

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Description:** Malicious users inject harmful scripts into web pages that execute when other users visit those pages.  
**Example Scenario:** An attacker submits a prompt containing hidden JavaScript code that steals login cookies when a customer service representative views the request history.  
**Impact if Unaddressed:** User account hijacking, theft of authentication credentials, unauthorized access to customer data.  
**Mitigation:** Deployed input filtering that detects and blocks 9 types of malicious script patterns (e.g., `<script>` tags, `javascript:` URLs) before processing user requests.  
**Compliance Mapping:** OWASP Top 10 A03:2021, NIST CSF PR.DS-5, ISO 27001 A.14.2.1

### SQL Injection
**Description:** Attackers manipulate database queries by inserting database commands into user input fields.  
**Example Scenario:** A user enters a specially crafted prompt that tricks the system into revealing all customer email addresses from the database.  
**Impact if Unaddressed:** Complete database compromise, theft of all customer records, deletion of business-critical data.  
**Mitigation:** Implemented input validation that identifies and blocks database command patterns (e.g., `SELECT`, `DROP TABLE`, `UNION`) in user submissions.  
**Compliance Mapping:** OWASP Top 10 A03:2021, NIST CSF PR.DS-1, ISO 27001 A.14.2.5

### Command Injection
**Description:** Malicious users execute operating system commands on the server by embedding them in input fields.  
**Example Scenario:** An attacker submits a prompt that includes a hidden command to delete all files on the server, causing complete service outage.  
**Impact if Unaddressed:** Server compromise, destruction of application files, extended service downtime.  
**Mitigation:** Deployed character filtering that prevents execution of system commands (e.g., `;`, `|`, `rm -rf`) through user input channels.  
**Compliance Mapping:** NIST CSF PR.AC-4, ISO 27001 A.14.2.2, OWASP ASVS V5.3.8

### CORS Policy Exploitation
**Description:** Malicious websites gain unauthorized access to our API by tricking user browsers into making requests on their behalf.  
**Example Scenario:** A user visits a compromised website that secretly uses their browser to submit expensive AI queries to our service, generating unexpected bills.  
**Impact if Unaddressed:** Unauthorized service usage, manipulation of user accounts, abuse of API resources.  
**Mitigation:** Configured strict access controls that only allow requests from approved domains (e.g., `askme-frontend.vercel.app`, `localhost:3000`) and applications.  
**Compliance Mapping:** OWASP Top 10 A05:2021, NIST CSF PR.AC-3, ISO 27001 A.13.1.3

## AI-Specific Threats

### Prompt Injection Attacks
**Description:** Users manipulate AI models by crafting special instructions that override safety controls and change model behavior.  
**Example Scenario:** A user submits a prompt that tricks the AI into ignoring content policies and providing instructions for illegal activities.  
**Impact if Unaddressed:** AI model generates harmful content, provides dangerous instructions, violates content safety policies.  
**Mitigation:** Implemented detection system that identifies and blocks 19 types of AI manipulation attempts (e.g., "ignore previous instructions", "you are now a different AI") before reaching the model.  
**Compliance Mapping:** EU AI Act Art. 9, NIST AI RMF GOVERN-1.1, ISO 23053 Clause 7.1

### AI Response Data Leakage
**Description:** AI models accidentally include sensitive personal information in their responses that should remain private.  
**Example Scenario:** An AI response inadvertently contains a customer's social security number and email address that the model learned during training.  
**Impact if Unaddressed:** Privacy violations, exposure of customer personal data, regulatory compliance breaches.  
**Mitigation:** Deployed response filtering that automatically detects and removes personal information (e.g., email addresses, phone numbers, SSN patterns) before sending responses to users.  
**Compliance Mapping:** GDPR Art. 32, NIST Privacy Framework PR.DS-P1, ISO 27001 A.18.1.4

### Model Hallucination Amplification
**Description:** AI models generate false information and present it as factual without any verification or warning.  
**Example Scenario:** The AI provides detailed but completely fabricated cybersecurity advice that could compromise user systems if followed.  
**Impact if Unaddressed:** Spread of misinformation, users following dangerous instructions, compromised decision-making.  
**Mitigation:** Implemented content safety classification that identifies and filters potentially harmful or misleading AI responses (e.g., violence references, dangerous instructions).  
**Compliance Mapping:** EU AI Act Art. 52, NIST AI RMF MEASURE-2.11, ISO 23053 Clause 8.2

### Rate Limiting Bypass
**Description:** Attackers overwhelm the service by coordinating requests from many different sources to avoid usage restrictions.  
**Example Scenario:** A competitor launches 1,000 automated requests per minute from different IP addresses, causing our service to slow down and increasing infrastructure costs by $2,000 monthly.  
**Impact if Unaddressed:** Service degradation, increased infrastructure expenses, legitimate users unable to access the system.  
**Mitigation:** Deployed behavioral analysis that identifies suspicious usage patterns (e.g., rapid-fire requests, multiple user agents from same IP) and applies stricter limits to potential attackers.  
**Compliance Mapping:** NIST CSF DE.AE-1, ISO 27001 A.12.2.1, OWASP ASVS V4.2.2

### Information Disclosure via Error Messages
**Description:** Detailed error messages reveal internal security mechanisms that attackers can use to plan more sophisticated attacks.  
**Example Scenario:** Error messages that say "XSS attack blocked" tell attackers exactly which security controls to bypass, enabling them to craft more effective attacks.  
**Impact if Unaddressed:** Attackers gain intelligence about security defenses, increased likelihood of successful security breaches.  
**Mitigation:** Implemented generic error responses (e.g., "Request could not be processed" instead of "XSS attack blocked") that provide no information about internal security measures to potential attackers.  
**Compliance Mapping:** OWASP Top 10 A09:2021, NIST CSF PR.IP-12, ISO 27001 A.12.4.1
