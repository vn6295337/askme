## üîß Implementation Details

### Build System Enhancements

1. **IntegrityPlugin**: Custom Gradle plugin that:
   - Verifies script line count (>200 lines expected)
   - Checks CLASSPATH completeness
   - Generates comprehensive checksums
   - Validates file integrity

2. **Atomic Build Process**: 
   - Builds to temporary directory
   - Validates before final placement
   - Prevents partial/corrupted builds

3. **Enhanced Verification**:
   - Multi-level file integrity checks
   - Null-byte detection
   - Archive extraction testing
   - Script execution validation

### Distribution Strategy

1. **Multiple Formats**:
   - Standard tar.gz and zip archives
   - Self-extracting shell scripts
   - Docker containerized distribution
   - Repository-embedded builds

2. **Fallback Sources**:
   - GitHub Releases (primary)
   - GitHub Raw files (backup)
   - CDN mirrors (jsDelivr, GitHack, Statically)
   - Repository source builds (last resort)

3. **Universal Downloader**:
   - Tries multiple sources in order
   - Automatic fallback on failure
   - Source build capability
   - Integrity verification

### Monitoring System

1. **Health Monitoring**:
   - GitHub API integration
   - Asset download and verification
   - CLI functionality testing
   - Backup distribution validation

2. **Automated Workflows**:
   - Scheduled monitoring (every 6 hours)
   - Issue creation on failures
   - Health report generation
   - Artifact uploads for tracking

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

### For Developers

1. **Building with Enhanced Verification**:
   ```bash
   cd 300_implementation/askme-cli
   ./gradlew atomicBuild
   ```

2. **Creating Release with Full Validation**:
   ```bash
   ./700_scripts/705_build_release_enhanced.sh 1.2.3
   ```

3. **Creating Backup Distributions**:
   ```bash
   ./700_scripts/706_create_backup_distributions.sh 1.2.3
   ./700_scripts/707_setup_fallback_system.sh 1.2.3
   ```

### For Release Management

1. **Manual Health Check**:
   ```bash
   ./700_scripts/708_release_health_monitor.sh 1.2.3
   ```

2. **Validate All Releases**:
   ```bash
   ./700_scripts/709_continuous_validation.sh
   ```

### For Users

1. **Verified Download**:
   ```bash
   # Download verification script
   curl -L -O https://github.com/vn6295337/askme/releases/download/v1.2.3/verify-v1.2.3.sh
   chmod +x verify-v1.2.3.sh
   ./verify-v1.2.3.sh 1.2.3
   ```

2. **Universal Downloader** (with automatic fallback):
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://github.com/vn6295337/askme/raw/main/DOWNLOAD_ASKME.sh | bash
   ```
