### 3. CLI Functionality Testing

#### 3.1 Help System
**Status**: ✅ **PASS**
```bash
./cliApp/build/install/cliApp/bin/cliApp --help

# Output
Usage: askme options_list
Options: 
    --model, -m [google] -> LLM model provider { String }
    --promptFile, -f -> File containing prompt text { String }
    --interactive, -i [false] -> Interactive mode 
    --help, -h -> Usage info
```

#### 3.2 File-Based Input
**Status**: ✅ **PASS**
```bash
echo "What is 2+2?" > test_question.txt
./cliApp/build/install/cliApp/bin/cliApp -f test_question.txt

# Output
🤖 askme CLI - Processing prompt from file: test_question.txt
🎯 Selected model: google
💬 Response: 2 + 2 = 4
```

#### 3.3 Interactive Mode
**Status**: ✅ **PASS**
```bash
./cliApp/build/install/cliApp/bin/cliApp -i

# Output
🤖 askme CLI - Interactive Mode
🎯 Selected model: google
📝 Enter prompt: what is the capital of antartica
💬 Response: Antarctica doesn't have a capital city...
```

#### 3.4 Provider Switching

```bash
./cliApp/build/install/cliApp/bin/cliApp -m mistral -f test_question.txt

# Output  
🤖 askme CLI - Processing prompt from file: test_question.txt
🎯 Selected model: mistral
💬 Response: The sum of 2 + 2 is 4. Here it is:
 2
+2
____
 4
```

### 4. Direct Question Testing (Initial)
**Status**: ❌ **FAIL** → ✅ **FIXED**

**Initial Issue**:
```bash
./cliApp/build/install/cliApp/bin/cliApp "What is 2+2?"

# Output
Too many arguments! Couldn't process argument What is 2+2?!
```

**Root Cause**: CLI argument parser only supported file (`-f`) and interactive (`-i`) modes, not direct question arguments.

**Fix Implemented**: Modified `Main.kt` to add optional question argument:
```kotlin
val question by parser.argument(ArgType.String, description = "Direct question to ask").optional()
```

**Post-Fix Testing**:
```bash
./cliApp/build/install/cliApp/bin/cliApp "What is 2+2?"

# Output
🤖 askme CLI - Direct Question
🎯 Selected model: google
💬 Response: 2 + 2 = 4
```

### 5. Error Handling Testing
**Status**: ✅ **PASS**

#### 5.1 Invalid Provider
```bash
./cliApp/build/install/cliApp/bin/cliApp -m invalid_provider -f test_question.txt

# Output
💬 Response: ❌ Provider invalid_provider not implemented yet
```

#### 5.2 Unavailable Provider
```bash
./cliApp/build/install/cliApp/bin/cliApp -m openai -f test_question.txt

# Output
💬 Response: ❌ Provider openai not implemented yet
```

### 6. Edge Case Testing
**Status**: ✅ **PASS**

#### 6.1 Special Characters
```bash
./cliApp/build/install/cliApp/bin/cliApp "How do you calculate 15% of \$1,000?"

# Output
💬 Response: To calculate 15% of $1,000, you can multiply 1000 by 0.15...
1000 * 0.15 = $150
```

#### 6.2 Provider with Direct Questions
```bash
./cliApp/build/install/cliApp/bin/cliApp -m mistral "What is the capital of Antarctica?"

# Output
🤖 askme CLI - Direct Question
🎯 Selected model: mistral
💬 Response: Antarctica does not have a capital city because it is not a country...
```

## 🚀 Improvements Made During Testing

### 1. Direct Question Support (Major UX Enhancement)
**Problem**: Users expect to run `askme "question"` directly  
**Solution**: Added optional question argument to CLI parser  
**Impact**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Significantly improved user experience  

**Before**:
```bash
# Required file creation
echo "question" > file.txt
./askme -f file.txt
```

**After**:
```bash
# Direct usage
./askme "question"
```

### 2. Documentation Updates
**Enhanced**: README with prominent direct question examples  
**Added**: Troubleshooting section for common issues
