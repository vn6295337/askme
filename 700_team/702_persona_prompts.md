## Usage Instructions

### Individual File Extraction
To extract individual files from this collection:

1. **Copy the desired section** starting from `## File: [filename].md` 
2. **Save as** `[filename].md` 
3. **Remove** the `## File: [filename].md` header line

### Quick Reference
- **Total Files**: 13 persona prompts (CLI MVP focus)
- **Executive Layer**: 1 file (aiProjectManager.md)
- **Foundation Layer**: 4 files (checkpointOrchestrator.md, toolInstallationSpecialist.md, environmentValidator.md, dependencyResolutionAgent.md)
- **Development Layer**: 4 files (kmpCoreDeveloper.md, apiIntegrationSpecialist.md, securityConfigurationAgent.md, cliDevelopmentSpecialist.md)
- **Quality Layer**: 3 files (buildValidationSpecialist.md, performanceMonitor.md, recoveryTroubleshootingAgent.md)
- **Delivery Layer**: 1 file (documentationManager.md)

### CLI MVP Implementation Focus
Each persona prompt is optimized for:
- ✅ CLI application development priority
