## üîç Validation Methods

### 1. Approved Company Verification
Models from pre-verified North American and European companies:
```javascript
approvedCompanies: [
  'openai', 'anthropic', 'google', 'microsoft', 'cohere',
  'mistral', 'huggingface', 'deepmind', 'stability', 'ai21'
]
```

### 2. Regional Origin Verification
Models with clear approved region indicators:
```javascript
allowedRegions: {
  'north america': ['na', 'american', 'openai', 'anthropic', 'cohere'],
  'europe': ['eu', 'european', 'mistral', 'huggingface'],
  'mediterranean': ['ai21']
}
```

### 3. Approved Model Pattern Recognition
Recognition of established approved region model families:
```javascript
approvedPatterns: [
  /\bgpt-/i, /\bclaude/i, /\bgemini/i, /\bllama/i, /\bmistral/i
]
```

## üìä Validation Output

## üìà Validation Statistics

The validation process reports approved models:
- Total models verified across all providers
- Approved models from designated economic regions
- Provider-specific validation results
- Geographic origin verification rates

```
‚úÖ Validation complete:
- Total models verified: 89
- Approved models (North America/Europe): 89
- Verification rate: 100%
- Providers with approved models: 9/9
```

Example metadata output:
```json
{
  "geographic_filtering": {
    "enabled": true,
    "allowed_regions": ["North America", "Europe"],
    "approved_models": 89,
    "verification_success_rate": "100%",
    "providers_validated": 9
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Updates
The approved regions list requires periodic updates:

1. **New Companies:** Monitor emerging AI companies in designated economic regions
2. **Model Releases:** Track new releases from approved companies and regions
3. **Company Verification:** Verify geographic origins of new AI companies
4. **Partnership Assessment:** Monitor partnerships to ensure continued compliance

### Data Sources for Updates
- AI company announcements from approved economic regions
- Model leaderboards with verified company origins
- Academic publications from designated regions
- Industry reports on approved region AI development
- Official company documentation and registration records

### Validation Accuracy
To ensure accurate approval:
- Verify all approved models have clear approved region provenance
- Regular audits of approved company lists
- Continuous monitoring of model origin verification
- Update approval criteria based on new company formations

## üîÑ Operational Procedures

### New Approved Model Integration
1. Verify company origin in designated economic regions
2. Add to `approvedCompanies` list if from verified region
3. Update pattern matching for new naming conventions
4. Trigger validation to include new approved models
5. Document addition for future reference

### Company Verification Process
1. Research company headquarters and primary development locations
2. Verify alignment with approved economic regions
3. Add to approved companies list if verification passes
4. Update regional indicators as needed
5. Re-run validation to include newly approved models

### Model Addition Workflow
When new models from approved companies are released:
1. Automatic inclusion if from pre-approved company
2. Pattern recognition for established model families
3. Manual verification for new company subsidiaries
4. Documentation update for new model patterns

### Partnership Evaluation
For models developed through partnerships:
1. Verify primary development occurs in approved regions
2. Ensure majority control remains with approved entities
3. Assess technology transfer implications
4. Maintain approval only if compliance standards met

### Continuous Compliance
Regular procedures to maintain compliance:
1. Monitor approved companies for geographic changes
2. Track new model releases from approved sources
3. Verify continued alignment with approval criteria
4. Update documentation to reflect current status

This geographic filtering system ensures the askme CLI includes only models from approved North American and European economic regions, maintaining compliance while providing access to leading AI capabilities from designated allied economic zones.
