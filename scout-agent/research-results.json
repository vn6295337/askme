It uses the same dense decoder-only transformer architecture as Phi-4, but generates longer, more comprehensive outputs structured into a step-by-step reasoning trace and final answer.\n\nWhile it offers improved benchmark scores over Phi-4-reasoning across tasks like AIME, OmniMath, and HumanEvalPlus, its responses are typically ~50% longer, resulting in higher latency. Designed for English-only applications, it is well-suited for structured reasoning workflows where output quality takes priority over response speed.",
