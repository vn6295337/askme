# Risk Management Documentation

> **Traceability:** Each atomic checklist item in [Checklist](105_checklist.md) is mapped to its corresponding reference in [Project Plan](107_project_plan.md) for full traceability.

## Purpose
This document identifies potential risks for the AskMe project, assesses their severity and probability, specifies the project phase(s) where they are most relevant, and outlines strategies to mitigate them. Keeping this document updated will help ensure project success and resilience.

---

| Risk ID | Description | Severity (High/Med/Low) | Probability (High/Med/Low) | Project Phase(s) | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|-------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|---------------------|
| R1 | Integration issues with multiple LLM providers | High | Medium | Development, Testing | Start with one provider, use abstraction/interface, add others incrementally, write integration tests early |
| R2 | Privacy or data leakage | High | Low | Design, Development, Testing, Release | Enforce strict data handling, no data collection, regular privacy reviews, static analysis for leaks |
| R3 | Performance below target (size, speed) | High | Medium | Development, Testing | Profile early, optimize dependencies, test on low-end devices, set up performance benchmarks |
| R4 | Cross-platform compatibility bugs | Medium | Medium | Development, Testing | Use CI for all platforms, test on real devices, modularize platform-specific code |
| R5 | Incomplete or outdated documentation | Medium | Medium | All phases | Assign doc owners, review docs at each milestone, automate doc checks in CI |
| R6 | Security vulnerabilities | High | Low | Design, Development, Testing | Use secure coding practices, static analysis, regular security reviews, dependency audits |
| R7 | Delays due to resource constraints | Medium | Medium | Planning, Development | Prioritize MVP, parallelize tasks, regular check-ins, adjust scope if needed |
| R8 | Poor user experience (UX/UI) | Medium | Medium | Design, Development, Testing | Early wireframes, user feedback, iterative design, usability testing |
| R9 | Unclear requirements or scope creep | Medium | Medium | Planning, Development | Regularly review user stories, lock scope for MVP, document changes |
| R10 | Lack of early user feedback | Medium | High | Development, Testing | Share prototypes early, set up feedback channels, iterate quickly |
