# Problem Statement & Goal

## Problem
Users need a simple, privacy-focused way to interact with various LLM providers without the complexity of existing solutions. Current options either require:
- Complex setup and configuration
- User accounts and data collection
- Compromised privacy through data sharing
- Unnecessary features that increase complexity

## MVP Goal
Create a lightweight, open-source Android and Linux CLI application that allows users to:
1. Connect to multiple free LLM providers
2. Ask questions and receive responses
3. Switch between different LLM models
4. Operate completely offline when using local models
5. Maintain user privacy with no data collection

### Success Metrics
- Response time < 2 seconds for local models
- App size < 20MB
- Zero data collection or tracking
- Support for at least 3 LLM providers
- Basic offline functionality
