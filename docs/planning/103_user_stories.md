# User Stories

## Core Flows

### Authentication & Setup
- As a new user, I want to use the app immediately without creating an account so I can get started quickly
- As a user, I want to easily configure API keys for different LLM providers so I can use my preferred services
- As a privacy-conscious user, I want to verify that no data is collected or stored so I can trust the application

### Core Functionality
- As a user, I want to type or speak my question so I can get quick answers
- As a user, I want to see the response in a clean, readable format so I can easily understand the information
- As a user, I want to switch between different LLM models (e.g., local vs. cloud) so I can balance speed and quality
- As a user, I want to copy responses to clipboard so I can use them in other applications

### Privacy & Offline Use
- As a user, I want to use the app completely offline with local models so I can maintain privacy
- As a user, I want to clear my conversation history with one click so I can protect my data
- As a user, I want to verify that my queries aren't being logged or stored so I can ask sensitive questions

### User Experience
- As a mobile user, I want a clean, intuitive interface so I can focus on my queries
- As a CLI user, I want keyboard shortcuts and command-line arguments so I can work efficiently
- As a visually impaired user, I want the app to be accessible with screen readers so I can use it independently

### Technical Requirements
- As a user with limited storage, I want the app to be lightweight (under 20MB) so it doesn't take up too much space
- As a developer, I want clear documentation so I can contribute to the project
- As a power user, I want to customize the model parameters so I can fine-tune the responses
